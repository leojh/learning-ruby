#About [TEALS]
From the TEALS Website:

TEALS (Technology Education And Literacy in Schools) is a grassroots program that recruits, trains, mentors, and places high tech professionals from across the country who are passionate about computer science education into high school classes as volunteer teachers in a team teaching model where the school district is unable to meet their studentsâ€™ computer science (CS) needs on its own.
